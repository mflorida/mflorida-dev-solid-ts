# Welcome to my over-engineered website!

This repo contains the highly over-engineered souce
code for my personal website. The source is intentionally
over-engineered to showcase use of front-end libraries
and some modern coding patterns that would be more suitable
for a much larger website or web application.

I've chosen SolidJS ('Solid') for the front-end library, and
Vite for the bundler and build tool, but could've just as easily
used ReactJS and Webpack _\[shudder\]_ or even just plain HTML
and CSS, without a line of JavaScript. But that's no fun!

## Why Vite and SolidJS? 

I really like the patterns and conventions used in Solid
and feel the handling of state changes through signals is 
much more straightforward and intuitive. Solid uses JSX
so HTML and component composition is basically the same
as React.

## What's next?

I'd like to incorporate the use of CSS modules to demonstrate
how they help in 'scoping' styles in a way that makes
sense to those familiar with writing CSS as well as those
used to writing CSS-in-JS with libraries like Emotion and
Styled Components. [StyleX](https://stylex-docusaurus.vercel.app/) 
looks interesting too! I could also just use Tailwind CSS -
I've got a lot of experience with Tailwind, love the philosophy,
but would like to explore other options for my own curiosity.
