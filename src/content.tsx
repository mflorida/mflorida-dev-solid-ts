      <p>
        I'm an experienced senior front-end developer currently looking to join a team who's passionate about
        shipping quality code that delivers real-world benefits in UX for end-users as well as fostering good
        DX through thoughtfully built component libraries and APIs.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've worked in all stages of the development lifecycle, from whiteboarding to release, and always keep
        a project's overall goals in mind when contributing in ways that leverage my skills and experience. I'm
        eager to learn and implement new technologies when needed. I know when to dig into code and when to dig
        for more information before cracking open an IDE. I'm also comfortable diving into back-end code when
        necessary to help track down an issue or identify an area that needs tweaking.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a front-end developer, I take UX and DX very seriously. I'm passionate about creating performant and
        intuitive UIs using modern best practices with front-end technologies including JavaScript, React,
        TypeScript, semantic HTML, advanced CSS, Webpack, Tailwind CSS, etc. I thrive on collaborating with other
        specialists such as: UX designers, back-end developers, QA, and DevOps engineers. I'm also comfortable
        interfacing directly with clients and stakeholders as needed.
