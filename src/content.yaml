  profile:
    - >
      I'm an experienced senior front-end developer currently looking to join a team who's passionate about
      shipping quality code that delivers real-world benefits in UX for end-users as well as fostering good
      DX through thoughtfully built component libraries and APIs.

    - >
      I've worked in all stages of the development lifecycle, from whiteboarding to release, and always keep
      a project's overall goals in mind when contributing in ways that leverage my skills and experience. I'm
      eager to learn and implement new technologies when needed. I know when to dig into code and when to dig
      for more information before cracking open an IDE. I'm also comfortable diving into back-end code when
      necessary to help track down an issue or identify an area that needs tweaking.

    - > 
      As a front-end developer, I take UX and DX very seriously. I'm passionate about creating performant and
      intuitive UIs using modern best practices with front-end technologies including JavaScript, React,
      TypeScript, semantic HTML, advanced CSS, Webpack, Tailwind CSS, etc. I thrive on collaborating with other
      specialists such as: UX designers, back-end developers, QA, and DevOps engineers. I'm also comfortable
      interfacing directly with clients and stakeholders as needed.
